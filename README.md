### Delivery Time Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

### Overview:
This project focused on predicting delivery times using a dataset containing historical information about deliveries. The dataset included various features such as delivery distances, product types, and other relevant factors. We first performed data preprocessing to clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables into a suitable numerical format. After the preprocessing steps, we trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the delivery time based on these input features.

### Results:
After training the Artificial Neural Network on the processed dataset, the model produced a test loss of 64%. This indicates that while the model did not perfectly predict delivery times, it was able to provide a reasonable approximation given the complexity of the problem. The high test loss suggests that further improvements in feature engineering or model tuning might be needed to achieve better performance.

### Conclusion:
The project demonstrated how Artificial Neural Networks can be applied to the task of predicting delivery times, which is essential for improving logistics and supply chain management. While the model achieved a test loss of 64%, this highlights the importance of further refining the model through additional data preprocessing, feature selection, or more advanced neural network architectures. The findings also emphasize the need for a better understanding of the underlying factors that influence delivery time predictions in real-world scenarios.
